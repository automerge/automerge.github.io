This is the interactive demo that runs on the home page.

To work on this demo:

1. `cd demo`
2. `npm i`
3. `vite build --watch`

As you make changes to the TS code in this folder, Vite will recompile everything into the correct path within the website `content/` folder. You can then run `site` in a separate tab to see your changes live on the home page.

The main entrypoint is `src/demo.ts`
