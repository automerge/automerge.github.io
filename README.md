# The Automerge Website

This repository holds the [Automerge website](https://automerge.org), including all the docs, blog posts, and other site **content**, the **templates** that give pages their structure and styling, and a custom build **system** that weaves it all together.

<br><br>

# Getting Started

First:
* Clone the repo and run `npm install` (or `yarn`, or `pnpm`â€¦ whatever you use, it'll probably work).

Henceforth:
* Run `site` to build the website and spin up a live-reloading dev server.
* Run `site help` to see other available commands.

> If `site` doesn't work, use `./site` instead (or add `.` to your $PATH)
