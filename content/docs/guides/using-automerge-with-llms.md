# Using Automerge with LLMs

We support the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) standard for making documentation available to large language models.

We offer the following pages:

<!-- needs to be an anchor link, because for markdown links a / is appended at the end -->

- <a href="/llms.txt" target="_blank">`llms.txt`</a> — a listing of the available pages
- <a href="/llms-full.txt" target="_blank">`llms-full.txt`</a> — complete documentation
