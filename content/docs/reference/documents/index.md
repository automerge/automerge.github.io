# Document Data Model

Automerge documents are quite similar to JSON objects. A document always consists of a root map which is a map from strings to other automerge values, which can themselves be composite types.

The types in automerge are:

- Composite types
  - Maps
  - [List](lists)
  - [Text](text)
- Scalar (non-composite) types:
  - IEEE 754 64 bit floating point numbers
  - Unsigned integers
  - Signed integers
  - Booleans
  - Strings
  - Timestamps
  - Counters
  - Byte arrays

See [below](#javascript-language-mapping) for how these types map to JavaScript types.

## Maps

Maps have string keys and any automerge type as a value. "string" here means a unicode string. The underlying representation in automerge is as UTF-8 byte sequences but they are exposed as utf-16 strings in javascript.

## Lists

A list is an ordered sequence of automerge values. The underlying data structure is an RGA sequence, which means that concurrent insertions and deletions can be merged in a manner which attempts to preserve user intent.

## Text

Text is an implementation of the [peritext](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/) CRDT. This is conceptually similar to a [list](#lists) where each element is a single unicode scalar value representing a single character. In addition to the characters `Text` also supports "marks". Marks are tuples of the form `(start, end, name, value)` which have the following meanings:

- `start` - the index of the beginning of the mark
- `end` - the index of the end of the mark
- `name` - the name of the mark
- `value` - any scalar (as in automerge scalar) value

For example, a bold mark from characters 1 to 5 might be represented as `(1, 5, "bold", true)`.

Note that the restriction to scalar values for the value of a mark will be lifted in future, although mark values will never be mutable - instead you should always create a new mark when updating a value. For now, if you need complex values in a mark you should serialize the value to a string.

## Timestamps

Timestamps are the integer number of milliseconds since the unix epoch (midnight 1970, UTC).

## Counter

Counters are a simple CRDT which just merges by adding all concurrent operations. They can be incremented and decremented.

## Javascript language mapping

The mapping to javascript is accomplished with the use of proxies. This means that in the javascript library maps appear as `object`s and lists appear as `Array`s. There is only one numeric type in javascript - `number` - so the javascript library guesses a bit. If you insert a javascript `number` for which [`Number.isInteger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isInteger) returns `true` then the number will be inserted as an integer, otherwise it will be a floating point value.

There are two representations for strings. Plain old javascript `string`s represent collaborative text. This means that you should modify these strings using `Automerge.splice` or `Automerge.updateText`, this will ensure that your changes merge well with concurrent changes. On the other hand, non-collaborative text is represented using `ImmutableString`, which you create using `new Automerge.ImmutableString`.

Timestamps are represented as javascript `Date`s.

Counters are represented as instances of the `Counter` class.

Putting it all together, here's an example of an automerge document containing all the value types:

```typescript
import * as A from "@automerge/automerge";

let doc = A.from({
  map: {
    key: "value",
    nested_map: { key: "value" },
    nested_list: [1],
  },
  list: ["a", "b", "c", { nested: "map" }, ["nested list"]],
  text: "world",
  raw_string: new A.ImmutableString("immutablestring"),
  integer: 1,
  float: 2.3,
  boolean: true,
  bytes: new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]),
  date: new Date(),
  counter: new A.Counter(1),
  none: null,
});

doc = A.change(doc, (d) => {
  // Insert 'Hello' at the beginning of the string
  A.splice(d, ["text"], 0, 0, "Hello ");
  d.counter.increment(20);
  d.map.key = "new value";
  d.map.nested_map.key = "new nested value";
  d.list[0] = "A";
  d.list.insertAt(0, "Z");
  d.list[4].nested = "MAP";
  d.list[5][0] = "NESTED LIST";
});

console.log(doc);

// Prints
// {
//   map: {
//     key: 'new value',
//     nested_map: { key: 'new nested value' },
//     nested_list: [ 1 ]
//   },
//   list: [ 'Z', 'A', 'b', 'c', { nested: 'MAP' }, [ 'NESTED LIST' ] ],
//   text: 'Hello world',
//   raw_string: ImmutableString { val: 'ImmutableString' },
//   integer: 1,
//   float: 2.3,
//   boolean: true,
//   bytes: Uint8Array(3) [ 1, 2, 3 ],
//   date: 2023-09-11T13:35:12.229Z,
//   counter: Counter { value: 21 },
//   none: null
// }
```
