## Collaboration isn't an afterthought, it's foundational to what and how we build.

### From our community calls to our sync protocol, we believe software should connect people, not silo them.


### Discord

Follow along as we develop Automerge, see cool projects made by other folks in the community, and share projects of your own.
* Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/zKGe4DCfgR)

### Community Calls

Every month we host a 1-hour call to share behind-the-scenes info about the development of Automerge, preview new features, and spotlight demos made by members of the community. This is your chance to see what's coming next for Automerge.
* Subscribe to the [Luma](https://luma.com/automerge)

### Upcoming Events
* [Sync Conf](https://syncconf.dev) on Nov 12th, 2025 in San Francisco

### Ink & Switch
Automerge was created by the industrial research lab Ink & Switch, and it serves as the foundation for many of their subsequent prototypes and explorations. Visit their website to read essays and lab notes about local-first software, malleable software, universal version control, and more.
