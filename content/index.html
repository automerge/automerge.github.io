  <h2>Automerge is a local-first sync engine for multiplayer apps that works offline, prevents conflicts, and runs fast.</h2>
</section>

<div class="demo-bg" aria-label="One example of a good use of Automerge would be a collaborative task-list app, like you might use to coordinate a space flight. Multiple users could add their add their tasks to the list, and everyone would see those tasks instantly stream in — unless they're stuck in a temporal vortex! Thankfully, with rich offline support, all their notes about the desolation of space disasters would sync seamlessly as soon as they escaped.">

    <h4>Multiplayer</h4>
    <p>
      Multiple users, multiple cursors, and multiple devices — one document.
      A single source of truth for your data, mirrored on every client.

In this first image, two users collaborate, swapping changes back and forth, always converging on a consistent result.">

  <div class="offline unit">
    <h4>Offline</h4>
    <p>
      Full functionality when offline.
      Your changes queue locally, and everything syncs when you reconnect.

  <div class="conflict unit">
    <h4>Consistent</h4>
    <p>When users make overlapping edits, Automerge performs a consistent merge that prevents data loss, and gives you tools to control the outcome.</p>
  </div>

  <svg class="chop consistent" width="452" height="670" viewBox="30 540 452 670" alt="The third illustration — the offline user reconnects, and all three users sync their changes. Everyone converges on the same result.">

  <div class="versioned unit">
    <h4>Versioned</h4>
    <p>Automerge remembers every change. Branch fearlessly, experiment boldly. Your document's entire history lives locally, ready when you need it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="compact unit">
    <h4>Compact</h4>
    <p>Automerge supports millions of changes in a single doc. It uses a compressed columnar store on disk and in memory.</p>
  </div>

  <svg class="chop compact" width="420" height="276" viewBox="0 0 700 460" alt="The final illustration. The document is squished down to a small size, thanks to memory compression.">

  <div class="fast unit">
    <h4>Fast</h4>
    <p>Our high-performance sync engine lets you edit local documents and see results instantaneously without waiting for distant servers to respond.</p>

    <h2>The team behind Automerge.</h2>
    <p>For more than a decade, Automerge has been an independent open source project built by a serious, dedicated team of engineers and computer scientists. That team includes production engineers who cofounded Heroku, and computer scientists like renowned Cambridge professor Martin Kleppmann. We plan for the long-term, and think about where the project will be in a decade, not how to get through the next funding round.</p>
    <div js-dither><img src="/index/L1001254.jpg" alt="A dithered, retro-inspired photo of Martin Kleppmann, Peter van Hardenberg, and Orion Henry clustered around laptops, with looks of intense concentration on their faces."></div>
    <p>We are driven to build high performance, reliable software you can bet your project on. We develop rigorous academic proofs of our designs using theorem proving tools like Isabelle, and implement them using cutting edge performance techniques adopted from the database world. Our standard is to be both fast and correct.</p>
    <p>Our ongoing effort is supported by a variety of different groups. Industrial research lab <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">Ink & Switch</a> provides a baseline of full-time engineering staff, including lead maintainer Alex Good, Orion Henry, Brooklyn Zelenka, and John Mumm. We are also supported by open source sponsorship from partners like Fly.io and Prisma, support contracts and feature development funding from users like GoodNotes and Bowtie, and philanthropic funding from groups like NLNet, the Advanced Research + Invention Agency, and the Endless Foundation.</p>

    <p>We are also grateful to all the <a href="/community">members of our community</a> who write new libraries and integrations, contribute to the core repositories, or share their experiences building with Automerge. We maintain a list of <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo/tree/main/packages/automerge-repo#acknowledgements">open source contributors</a>, and invite you to join them.</p>
